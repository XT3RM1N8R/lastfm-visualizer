## Data
Data was taken from the Last.fm database using the Last.fm API. Data had to be filtered, formatted, aggregated, etc. in order to be usable.

## Findings
Visualization was not completed. Data failed to meet the standards of the visualization types that I intended to implement. I was unable to complete this on time. I was able to eventually retreive useful data, but I was unable to display this in a visualization on time.
