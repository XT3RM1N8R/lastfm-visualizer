## Data
Data was taken from the Last.fm database using the Last.fm API. Data had to be filtered, formatted, aggregated, etc. in order to be usable.

## Findings
Visualization was not completed. Data failed to meet the standards of the visualization types that I intended to implement. I was unable to complete this on time. I was able to eventually retreive useful data, but I was unable to display this in a visualization on time. 

The stacked continuous graphs require corresponding data entries for the X/Y points of each key, and I was not able to generate this data from the data I gathered from the Last.fm API on time.

## Important
The graph/chart seen in this example is not my own creation. I briefly modified an existing library: https://nvd3.github.io/nvd3/
